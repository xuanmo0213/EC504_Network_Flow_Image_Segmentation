### EC504 ImageSegmentation Project

#### Environment setup:
* Install python, note that we are currently using some external packages such as numpy, sklearn.
 If you haven't done so, we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), click through to install Python 2.7 version. For example, mac users:
 `bash Anaconda2-4.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh `
* Install opencv using conda. You will first have to initialize conda in your command line
`export PATH=~/anaconda2/bin:$PATH`
then
`conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv`

#### Make sure your have all the python packages at one directory:
1. image_process: include Gaussian Mixture and kmeans for likelihood score calculation
2. max_flow: core segmentation functions
3. main.py: driver program
Along with the zip we have also put a few toy images for test.

#### Now, in your commmand line
`~/anaconda2/bin/python main_2_0.py game.png`

Note that this is the absolute-correct-but-runs-slow version of our code. The program will prompt,
> Your image is in size 50 * 50

> Enter your desired scale ratio:

For game.png(50-by-50), we usually choose ratio = 2 to downsample it, then it takes about 20 secs to construct the adjacency list and 3 minutes (on our laptops) for max flow. When you are finished, mouse over to the pop-up windows, check the results and hit "return" to quit.


#### Latest Build and trouble shooting intructions:
As mentioned, we have actually implemented python-ctypes binding for both mincut algorithms and image preprocessing part, main_3_0.py has utilized mincut_clib.py in the maxflow folder to realize this process. Here are the instructions to compile and run this version,

1. change your current directory to max_flow folder and you will have to compile a bfs.so using:
`gcc -shared -Wl,-install_name,bfs.so -o bfs.so -fPIC bfs.c`


`cd ..`

2. Run main_3_0.py by typing,
`~/anaconda2/bin/python main_3_0.py game.png`

As we have explained ealier, you should get a success run by multiple attempts.

Finally, few comments and thoughts, as we did have a another version main_3_1.py, and it almost never runs because of the interruption of "segmentation faults". We think it is because we had two ctypes in order, when we are finished with the first one, graph_utils_ctypes in image_process, the error message would force this program to quit.
